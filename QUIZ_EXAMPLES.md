#### True/False Questions (3)

**6. The heart has four chambers: right and left atria, and right and left ventricles.**
- Difficulty: Easy
- Answer: **True**
- Explanation: The heart's four chambers work together in a coordinated manner: the atria receive blood while the ventricles pump it out.

**7. All blood vessels carrying blood away from the heart are veins.**
- Difficulty: Medium
- Answer: **False**
- Explanation: Blood vessels carrying blood away from the heart are arteries, while veins carry blood toward the heart. This is true regardless of whether the blood is oxygenated or deoxygenated.

**8. The heart generates its own electrical signals for contraction.**
- Difficulty: Hard
- Answer: **True**
- Explanation: The heart's sinoatrial (SA) node acts as a natural pacemaker, generating electrical impulses that trigger coordinated contractions without needing external nerve signals (though the nervous system can modulate the rate).

#### Short Answer Questions (3)

**9. Define systole and explain its role in the cardiac cycle.**
- Difficulty: Medium
- Expected Answer: "Systole is the contraction phase of the heartbeat when the heart's chambers squeeze to pump blood out. Atrial systole pumps blood into the ventricles, while ventricular systole pumps blood into the arteries to circulate through the body."

**10. What is coronary artery disease and why is it dangerous?**
- Difficulty: Hard
- Expected Answer: "Coronary artery disease occurs when plaque builds up in the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle itself. It's dangerous because it can reduce blood flow to the heart, potentially causing a heart attack if blood flow is blocked completely."

**11. Describe the pathway of a red blood cell through the heart.**
- Difficulty: Hard
- Expected Answer: "A red blood cell enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior vena cava, flows into the right ventricle, is pumped to the lungs via the pulmonary artery, returns oxygenated via pulmonary veins to the left atrium, flows into the left ventricle, and is pumped throughout the body via the aorta."

- Difficulty: Easy
- A) The speed of computation
- B) The connection strength between neurons ✓
- C) The number of layers in the network
- D) The types of activation functions used
- **Explanation**: Weights are multiplied with inputs to determine their importance in the network. Stronger weights mean the corresponding input has more influence on the neuron's output.

**3. What is the vanishing gradient problem?**
- Difficulty: Hard
- A) Gradients become too large during training
- B) Gradients become extremely small and weights stop updating ✓
- C) The network forgets how to process inputs
- D) Too many layers cause the network to collapse
- **Explanation**: During backpropagation through many layers, gradients can become exponentially small (especially with sigmoid activation), causing weights in early layers to barely update, preventing learning.

**4. Which type of neural network is specifically designed for processing images?**
- Difficulty: Medium

- A) How many epochs to train
- B) The size of weight adjustments during training ✓
- C) The number of neurons in each layer
- D) The type of activation function
- **Explanation**: The learning rate determines how large the weight updates are after each backpropagation step. Too high causes instability; too low causes slow convergence.

#### True/False Questions (3)

**6. A neural network with only one hidden layer can theoretically learn any continuous function.**
- Difficulty: Hard
- Answer: **True**
- Explanation: The universal approximation theorem states that a feedforward network with one hidden layer containing enough neurons can approximate any continuous function on a compact domain.

**7. Deep learning always produces better results than shallow neural networks.**
- Difficulty: Medium
- Answer: **False**
- Explanation: While deep networks can learn complex patterns, they require more data, more computational power, and careful tuning. For simpler problems, shallow networks may work better and faster.

**8. Overfitting occurs when a model performs perfectly on training data but poorly on new data.**
- Difficulty: Easy
- Answer: **True**
- Explanation: Overfitting happens when a model memorizes the training data rather than learning generalizable patterns, resulting in poor performance on unseen data.

#### Short Answer Questions (3)

**9. Explain what supervised learning means in the context of neural networks.**
- Difficulty: Medium
- Expected Answer: "Supervised learning involves training a neural network on labeled data where both inputs and correct outputs are provided. The network learns to map inputs to outputs by minimizing the error between predicted and actual outputs."

**10. What is the role of bias in a neural network neuron?**
- Difficulty: Medium
- Expected Answer: "Bias is a constant value added to the weighted sum of inputs before applying the activation function. It allows the network to shift the activation function horizontally, giving it more flexibility to fit data even when all inputs are zero."

**11. Describe how backpropagation calculates gradients for updating weights.**
- Difficulty: Hard
- Expected Answer: "Backpropagation works backwards through the network from output to input, calculating the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to each weight using the chain rule. These gradients show how much each weight contributes to the error, allowing weights to be updated in the direction that reduces loss."

#### True/False Questions (3)

**6. Dendrites carry signals away from the cell body to other neurons.**
- Difficulty: Easy
- Answer: **False**
- Explanation: Dendrites receive signals FROM other neurons and carry them TO the cell body. Axons carry signals AWAY from the cell body to other neurons.

**7. All neurons are electrically excited and can generate action potentials.**
- Difficulty: Hard
- Answer: **False**
- Explanation: While many neurons are excitatory, some are inhibitory and work to prevent action potentials. Additionally, not all cells with neural properties can generate action potentials (some have only graded potentials).

**8. The synapse is the structural junction between two neurons.**
- Difficulty: Easy
- Answer: **True**
- Explanation: A synapse consists of the axon terminal of the transmitting neuron, the synaptic cleft, and the receptor membrane of the receiving neuron, forming a functional and structural connection.

#### Short Answer Questions (3)

**9. Explain the process of neural signal transmission across a synapse.**
- Difficulty: Medium
- Expected Answer: "When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open. Calcium influx causes synaptic vesicles to release neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These molecules diffuse across the gap and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, triggering electrical or chemical changes in the receiving neuron."

**10. What is the significance of the all-or-nothing principle in action potentials?**
- Difficulty: Hard
- Expected Answer: "The all-or-nothing principle states that once an action potential is triggered by reaching threshold, it goes to completion at full strength. There are no 'partial' action potentials. This ensures reliable signal transmission over long distances without degradation and creates a consistent signal regardless of stimulus strength above threshold."

**11. How do inhibitory neurotransmitters differ from excitatory ones in their effects?**
- Difficulty: Medium
- Expected Answer: "Excitatory neurotransmitters make the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire by depolarizing the membrane potential (moving it closer to threshold). Inhibitory neurotransmitters make the neuron less likely to fire by hyperpolarizing the membrane (moving it away from threshold)."

#### Fill in the Blank Questions (2)

**12. The _____ is the part of the neuron that integrates signals from multiple dendrites and determines if the cell will generate an action potential.**
- Difficulty: Medium
- Answer: **axon hillock** (or: soma, cell body)
