# Animal Cell: The Basic Unit of Life

## Introduction

An **animal cell** is the smallest unit of life that can function independently and perform all life functions within an organism. Animal cells are eukaryotic cells, meaning they have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. These cells vary in size, shape, and structure depending on their specific function in the body.

## What is an Animal Cell?

Animal cells are the basic structural and functional units of animal tissues and organs. Unlike prokaryotic cells (such as bacteria), animal cells contain a defined nucleus and specialized organelles that perform specific functions. A typical animal cell is between 10 and 100 micrometers in diameter.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Eukaryotic:** Contains a membrane-bound nucleus
- **Membrane-bound organelles:** Houses various specialized structures
- **Cytoplasm:** Gel-like substance filling the cell
- **Cell membrane:** Controls what enters and exits the cell
- **No cell wall:** Unlike plant cells, animal cells lack a rigid outer wall

## The Cell Cycle

The **cell cycle** consists of:

1. **G1 Phase:** Cell growth and preparation
2. **S Phase:** DNA replication
3. **G2 Phase:** Final preparation for division
4. **M Phase:** Mitosis and cytokinesis

**Checkpoints:** Control mechanisms ensure proper cell division and prevent cancerous growth

---

## Cell Transport

Molecules move across the cell membrane through various processes:

### Passive Transport
- **Diffusion:** Movement from high to low concentration
- **Osmosis:** Movement of water across membrane
- **Facilitated diffusion:** Protein channels assist movement
- **No energy required**

### Active Transport
- **Against concentration gradient**
- **Requires ATP energy**
- **Examples:** Sodium-potassium pump

### Bulk Transport
- **Endocytosis:** Cell takes in large particles
- **Exocytosis:** Cell releases large particles

---

## Cell Size and Limitations

**Why are cells so small?**

1. **Surface area-to-volume ratio:** Large cells cannot efficiently exchange materials
2. **Nutrient diffusion:** Nutrients must reach the center of the cell
3. **Waste removal:** Toxic waste must be expelled efficiently
4. **Typical size:** 10-100 micrometers (10-100 μm)

**Exceptions:**
- Egg cells (largest): Up to 100 micrometers or more
- Red blood cells (smallest): About 7 micrometers

---

## Fascinating Facts

- **Cell membrane:** Completely replaced about every 9-10 days
- **Mitochondria:** Have their own DNA from ancient bacterial origins
- **Lysosomes:** Can digest and destroy bacteria and dead organelles
- **Centrosomes:** Only found in animal cells, not plant cells
- **Lifespan:** Average human cell lives 7-10 years (except red blood cells: 120 days)
- **Fastest dividing:** Intestinal cells (every 3-5 days)
