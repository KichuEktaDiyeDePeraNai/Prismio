# The Human Heart: Anatomy and Physiology

## Introduction

The **human heart** is a muscular, four-chambered organ that pumps blood throughout the body. Located in the mediastinum (between the lungs), the heart is approximately the size of a closed fist and weighs about 250-350 grams (8.8-12.3 ounces) in adults. It is the primary organ of the circulatory system and works continuously without rest to deliver oxygen-rich blood to all tissues and organs.

**Key Facts:**
- **Weight:** 250-350 grams
- **Size:** About the size of a fist
- **Location:** Left side of the chest, protected by the rib cage
- **Beats per minute:** 60-100 (at rest)
- **Total beats per day:** Approximately 100,000
- **Lifespan function:** Beats continuously for 70-80+ years

## Heart Overview

### Structure and Location

The heart is a hollow, muscular organ divided into four chambers:
- **Upper chambers (Atria):** Right and left atria receive blood
- **Lower chambers (Ventricles):** Right and left ventricles pump blood

### The Three Layers

**Epicardium (Visceral Pericardium)**
- Outer layer in direct contact with the heart
- Part of the serous pericardium
- Smooth membrane reducing friction

**Myocardium (Cardiac Muscle)**
- Thick, muscular middle layer
- Responsible for the heart's contractions
- Composed of cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes)
- Striated muscle unique to the heart

**Endocardium (Endothelium)**
- Inner lining of the heart chambers
- Smooth surface reduces friction with blood
- Contains conduction system components

### External Structure

**Pericardium**
- Double-walled sac surrounding the heart
- Provides protection and reduces friction
- Visceral pericardium (inner) and parietal pericardium (outer)
- Contains small amount of lubricating fluid

**Coronary Arteries**
- Supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle itself
- Left coronary artery and right coronary artery
- Critical for heart health and function

## Heart Structure

### The Four Chambers

**Right Atrium**
- Receives deoxygenated blood from the body
- Receives blood via superior and inferior vena cavae
- Thin-walled, low-pressure chamber
- Contracts to push blood into the right ventricle

**Right Ventricle**
- Pumps blood to the lungs
- Sends deoxygenated blood via the pulmonary artery
- Thinner walls than the left ventricle
- Develops less pressure than left ventricle

**Left Atrium**
- Receives oxygenated blood from the lungs
- Receives blood via four pulmonary veins
- Thin-walled chamber
- Contracts to push blood into the left ventricle

**Left Ventricle**
- Pumps oxygenated blood to the entire body
- Sends blood via the aorta
- Thickest and most muscular chamber
- Generates highest pressure (systolic pressure)

### The Septum

The **cardiac septum** divides the heart into left and right sides:
- **Atrial septum:** Separates the two atria
- **Ventricular septum:** Separates the two ventricles
- **Foramen ovale:** Opening in fetal heart (normally closes at birth)

---

## Heart Valves

### Valve Function

Heart valves maintain unidirectional blood flow and prevent backflow.

**Atrioventricular Valves (AV Valves)**
- Located between atria and ventricles
- Prevent blood from flowing backward into the atria

**Semilunar Valves**
- Located between ventricles and arteries
- Prevent blood from flowing back into the ventricles

### The Four Valves

**Tricuspid Valve**
- Between right atrium and right ventricle
- Has three cusps (leaflets)
- Prevents backflow into right atrium

**Mitral Valve (Bicuspid Valve)**
- Between left atrium and left ventricle
- Has two cusps
- Most commonly affected by heart disease

**Pulmonary Valve (Pulmonic Valve)**
- Between right ventricle and pulmonary artery
- Semilunar valve structure
- Prevents backflow into right ventricle

**Aortic Valve**
- Between left ventricle and aorta
- Semilunar valve structure
- Prevents backflow into left ventricle

### Heart Sounds

- **Lubb:** Closing of atrioventricular valves (S1)
- **Dupp:** Closing of semilunar valves (S2)
- "Lubb-dupp" pattern repeats with each heartbeat

## Blood Flow Through the Heart

### Systemic and Pulmonary Circulation

**Step-by-step blood flow:**

1. **Deoxygenated blood enters** the right atrium from the vena cava
2. **Right atrium contracts**, pushing blood through the tricuspid valve
3. **Blood fills** the right ventricle
4. **Right ventricle contracts**, pushing blood through the pulmonary valve
5. **Blood enters** the pulmonary artery to the lungs
6. **Oxygenated blood returns** from lungs via pulmonary veins
7. **Blood enters** the left atrium
8. **Left atrium contracts**, pushing blood through the mitral valve
9. **Blood fills** the left ventricle
10. **Left ventricle contracts** with maximum force
11. **Blood is ejected** through the aortic valve into the aorta
12. **Oxygenated blood** distributes throughout the body

**Important fact:** Oxygen-poor and oxygen-rich blood never mix due to the cardiac septum.

## The Cardiac Cycle

### Phases of the Heartbeat

**Atrial Systole**
- Duration: About 0.1 seconds
- Atria contract simultaneously
- Blood moves into ventricles
- Ventricles are in diastole (relaxed)

**Isovolumetric Ventricular Contraction**
- Ventricles begin contracting
- All four valves are closed
- Ventricular pressure increases rapidly
- No change in chamber volume

**Ventricular Ejection**
- Ventricles contract forcefully
- Semilunar valves open
- Blood is pumped into arteries
- About two-thirds of blood is ejected

**Isovolumetric Ventricular Relaxation**
- Ventricles begin to relax
- Atrioventricular valves close
- Semilunar valves close
- All four valves are momentarily closed

**Ventricular Filling (Diastole)**
- Ventricles relax completely
- Atrioventricular valves open
- Blood flows passively into ventricles
- Represents most of the cycle duration

### Duration and Heart Rate

- **Complete cycle:** One heartbeat
- **At rest:** About 0.8 seconds
- **Heart rate:** 60-100 beats per minute (normal adult)
- **Percentage of time:** Ventricles spend 2/3 of cycle relaxing

---

## Conduction System

The heart has its own electrical system:

### Sinoatrial (SA) Node
- Natural pacemaker of the heart
- Located in the right atrium
- Generates electrical impulses
- Rate: 60-100 beats per minute at rest

### Atrioventricular (AV) Node
- Located in the right atrium near the ventricles
- Delays signal to allow atrial contraction
- Transmits signal to ventricles

### Bundle of His
- Conducts signal from AV node
- Divides into left and right bundle branches

### Purkinje Fibers
- Transmit signal throughout the ventricles
- Cause coordinated ventricular contraction

---

## Coronary Circulation

### The Coronary Arteries

**Left Coronary Artery**
- Supplies left ventricle and left atrium
- Divides into left anterior descending and left circumflex
- Accounts for ~70% of blood supply

**Right Coronary Artery**
- Supplies right ventricle and right atrium
- Often supplies the SA and AV nodes
- Accounts for ~30% of blood supply

### Coronary Veins
- **Great cardiac vein:** Drains left ventricle
- **Middle cardiac vein:** Drains right ventricle
- **Small cardiac vein:** Drains right ventricle and right atrium
- **Coronary sinus:** Collects all coronary veins

---

## Heart Health and Disease

### Cardiac Output

**Cardiac output = Stroke volume × Heart rate**

- **Stroke volume:** Amount of blood pumped per beat (about 70 mL)
- **Cardiac output:** About 5 liters per minute at rest
- **Can increase:** 5-fold during intense exercise

### Common Heart Conditions

**Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)**
- Plaque buildup in coronary arteries
- Reduces blood flow to heart muscle
- Leading cause of heart attack

**Heart Failure**
- Heart cannot pump enough blood
- Can affect left, right, or both sides
- Causes fluid accumulation

**Arrhythmia**
- Abnormal heart rhythm
- Can be fast (tachycardia) or slow (bradycardia)
- May require intervention

**Heart Valve Disease**
- Stenosis: Valve doesn't open completely
- Regurgitation: Valve doesn't close completely
- Can cause blood to flow backward

### Heart Health Tips

1. **Exercise regularly:** 150 minutes moderate activity per week
2. **Eat healthy:** Low in salt, saturated fat, and cholesterol
3. **Maintain weight:** Obesity increases heart disease risk
4. **Don't smoke:** Smoking damages heart and blood vessels
5. **Manage stress:** Chronic stress affects heart health
6. **Get enough sleep:** 7-9 hours per night
7. **Control blood pressure:** High blood pressure damages the heart
8. **Limit alcohol:** Excessive drinking weakens the heart
