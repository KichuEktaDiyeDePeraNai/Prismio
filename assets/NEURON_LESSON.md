## Introduction

Neurons are the fundamental units of the nervous system, responsible for transmitting information throughout your body and brain. These remarkable cells enable you to think, move, feel, and respond to the world around you. Through this digital lesson, you'll explore the structure of neurons and understand how they communicate with each other to create all neurological functions.

## What is a Neuron?

A neuron, or nerve cell, is a specialized cell designed to transmit electrical and chemical messages. Your brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each connected to thousands of other neurons, forming the most complex network in the universe.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Specialized for information transmission
- Highly branched structure
- Can transmit signals over long distances
- Connected through synapses
- Generate and propagate electrical signals
- Can survive 80-100+ years (most neurons live as long as you do)

## Neuron Structure

### Three Main Parts

**1. Cell Body (Soma)**
- Contains the nucleus
- Houses most of the organelles
- Center of the neuron's metabolic activity
- Integrates signals from dendrites

**2. Dendrites**
- Branch-like extensions from cell body
- Receive signals from other neurons
- "Reception stations" for incoming information
- Can be numerous and extensively branched
- Increase surface area for signal reception

**3. Axon**
- Single long projection from cell body
- Transmits signals away from the cell body
- Can be incredibly long (up to 1 meter in some cases)
- Branches at the end (axon terminals)
- Transmits information to other neurons, muscles, or glands

### Axon Structure Details

**Axon Hillock:**
- Junction between cell body and axon
- Where action potentials are initiated
- Trigger zone for electrical signals

**Axon Initial Segment:**
- First part of the axon
- Critical for signal transmission
- Has lowest threshold for firing

**Nodes of Ranvier:**
- Gaps between myelin sheaths
- Allow faster signal propagation
- Spaced at regular intervals

**Axon Terminals (Terminal Buttons):**
- Branching endings of the axon
- Form synapses with other neurons
- Release neurotransmitters
- Communication points between neurons

## Types of Neurons

### Sensory Neurons (Afferent)
- Carry information from sensory receptors to central nervous system
- Respond to touch, light, sound, taste, smell, and pain
- Pseudo-unipolar structure
- Connect peripheral receptors to spinal cord and brain

### Motor Neurons (Efferent)
- Carry commands from central nervous system to muscles
- Multipolar neurons
- Control voluntary and involuntary movements
- Large, easily visible neurons

### Interneurons (Association Neurons)
- Connect other neurons together
- Most numerous type of neuron
- Process and integrate information
- Found primarily in brain and spinal cord
- Enable complex thought and coordination

## Neural Communication

### Action Potentials

**Resting Membrane Potential:**
- Normal state: -70 mV (inside negative relative to outside)
- Maintained by sodium-potassium pump
- Steady background voltage

**Depolarization (Excitation):**
- Positive ions enter the cell
- Membrane potential becomes less negative
- Can trigger an action potential if threshold reached

**Hyperpolarization (Inhibition):**
- Negative ions enter or positive ions leave
- Membrane potential becomes more negative
- Makes neuron less likely to fire

**Action Potential Phases:**
1. **Resting state:** Neuron at -70 mV
2. **Depolarization:** Rapid change to +30 mV
3. **Repolarization:** Return to negative values
4. **Hyperpolarization:** Brief overshoot
5. **Return to rest:** Back to -70 mV

**All-or-Nothing Principle:**
- Action potential either occurs completely or not at all
- Once threshold is reached, full depolarization occurs
- Cannot have "partial" action potentials

### Signal Propagation

**Along the Axon:**
- In unmyelinated axons: Continuous conduction
- In myelinated axons: Saltatory conduction
- Speed: 0.5-120 meters per second

## The Synapse

### Anatomy of a Synapse

**Presynaptic Element (Sending Side):**
- Axon terminal of transmitting neuron
- Contains synaptic vesicles with neurotransmitters
- Has mitochondria for energy production
- Calcium channels trigger vesicle release

**Synaptic Cleft:**
- Tiny gap between neurons (20-40 nanometers)
- Space where neurotransmitters diffuse
- Chemicals cross here to transmit signal

**Postsynaptic Element (Receiving Side):**
- Membrane of receiving neuron
- Contains receptor proteins
- Binds neurotransmitters
- Generates response in receiving cell

### Types of Synapses

- **Axodendritic:** Axon to dendrite (most common)
- **Axosomatic:** Axon to cell body
- **Axoaxonic:** Axon to axon
- **Dendrodendritic:** Dendrite to dendrite

## Neurotransmitters

### Key Signaling Molecules

**Excitatory Neurotransmitters:**
- Acetylcholine: Muscle contraction, learning, memory
- Glutamate: Most common excitatory, learning and plasticity
- Norepinephrine: Arousal, attention
- Dopamine: Reward, movement, mood

**Inhibitory Neurotransmitters:**
- GABA: Primary inhibitor in brain
- Glycine: Primary inhibitor in spinal cord
- Serotonin: Mood, sleep, appetite

### Neurotransmitter Function

1. Action potential reaches axon terminal
2. Calcium channels open
3. Synaptic vesicles release neurotransmitters
4. Neurotransmitters cross synaptic cleft
5. Bind to receptor proteins on postsynaptic membrane
6. Cause changes in postsynaptic neuron
7. Excess neurotransmitter removed by reuptake or enzymes

## Neural Plasticity

### The Brain's Ability to Change

**Structural Plasticity:**
- Brain reorganizes itself throughout life
- Can move functions to different areas
- Occurs after brain injury

**Functional Plasticity:**
- Different areas of brain take on new functions
- Develops with practice and learning
- More pronounced in younger brains

**Synaptic Plasticity:**
- Strength of synapses can increase or decrease
- Long-term potentiation (LTP): Strengthens connections
- Long-term depression (LTD): Weakens connections

**Neurogenesis:**
- Creation of new neurons (particularly in hippocampus)
- Continues throughout adulthood
- Enhanced by learning and exercise
